# CommunityBridge Mentorship

CommunityBridge Mentorship is a platform that offers a structured remote learning program for individuals. Experienced open source project professionals mentor aspiring individuals and help them contribute to the open source community. Linux Foundation matches a percentage of funds for the first 100 mentees from diverse backgrounds to help projects improve the diversity of their communities.

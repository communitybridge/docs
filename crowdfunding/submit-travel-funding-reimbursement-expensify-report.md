## Prepare for Reimbursement <a href="#submittravelfundingreimbursementexpensereport-prepareforreimbursement" id="submittravelfundingreimbursementexpensereport-prepareforreimbursement"></a>

Consider the following financial aspects of reimbursement:

* The Linux Foundation uses [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com)— a third-party expense management and payment application.

Have these items handy before you begin:

* Your receipts converted to USD
* The amount of your approved Travel Fund

## Set Up a Reimbursement Account in Expensify <a href="#submittravelfundingreimbursementexpensereport-setupareimbursementaccountinexpensify" id="submittravelfundingreimbursementexpensereport-setupareimbursementaccountinexpensify"></a>

You will receive an invitation email from the Expensify Concierge stating that you are added to a Linux Foundation Travel Funds Policy. Use the same email address linked to your travel funding approval to sign into an existing [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com) account or set up a new one. If you are using a United States bank, link Expensify to your bank or financial service account.

The Linux Foundation requires that international (non-U.S.) individuals receive reimbursements via wire transfer. Download the attached Wire Transfer form.

## Create and Submit an Expense Report <a href="#submittravelfundingreimbursementexpensereport-createandsubmitanexpensereport" id="submittravelfundingreimbursementexpensereport-createandsubmitanexpensereport"></a>

**To Create or Submit an Expense Report:**

1. Sign In to [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com).
2. Create and submit an expense report. For details, see [How to Create and Submit an Expensify Report](how-to-create-and-submit-an-expensify-report.md).\
   After you submit your report, the approver reviews your reimbursement request and approves or rejects it. Next, a Linux Foundation administrator validates the expense and approves or rejects the reimbursement. Expensify funds your account.
3. Upon approval notification, go to your account to access your reimbursement money. It may take up to 45 business days for the funds to be deposited to your bank account.\*

\*Wire Transfer recipients will get the funds deposited to their account directly from Linux Foundation.

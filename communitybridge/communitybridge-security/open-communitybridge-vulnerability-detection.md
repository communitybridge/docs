# Open CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection

Vulnerability Detection detects vulnerabilities in CommunityBridge projects. Projects that are part of the CommunityBridge receive free daily scans via the Vulnerability Detection service in order to detect vulnerabilities in code repositories as well as library dependencies. CommunityBridge projects include a Vulnerability Report, which gives an overview of vulnerability severities. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only project maintainers can access Vulnerability Detection details to gain visibility into open security issues and paths to remediation.
{% endhint %}

As a project maintainer, you can access vulnerability scan details for projects based on the CommunityBridge service you opted while enrolling your project:

* [Projects applied to CommunityBridge Funding](open-communitybridge-vulnerability-detection.md#projects-applied-to-communitybridge-funding)
* [Projects applied to CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection](open-communitybridge-vulnerability-detection.md#projects-applied-to-communitybridge-vulnerability-detetction)

**Note:** If you are not a project maintainer and/or not authorized to see vulnerability report for a project, you can [request access](open-communitybridge-vulnerability-detection.md#requesting-access-to-view-vulnerability-report) to see vulnerability scan details.

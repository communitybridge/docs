# Contribute to a Gerrit Project

As an individual contributor or a corporate \(employee\) contributor or to an open source project, you submit changed code in Gerrit to inform reviewers about the changes:

* As an individual contributor to an open-source project who is not associated to a company, you submit code in Gerrit and during the process, your CLA is verified. Also during the process, you click a link to open the CLA Contributor Console to sign the CLA Agreement. As an individual contributor, your work is owned by yourself \(Individual CLA\).
* If any of your contributions to the project are created as part of your employment, the work may not belong to you—it may be owned by your employer. In that case, the CCLA signatory represents the employer \(company\) for legal reasons, and signs the Corporate Contributor Licensing Agreement in order for your contribution to be accepted into the company. During the code submission process, your CLA status is verified.

  When all CLA management set-up tasks are complete and your CCLA signatory has signed a Corporate CLA, you simply confirm your association to the company during your first code submission. Then, you can continue. Your subsequent contributions will not require association confirmations.

**Do these steps:**

_If you are a project manager, make sure that you are logged out of the CLA Management Console before you begin._

1. In Gerrit, clone a repository under the Gerrit instance into your local machine.

2. Make a change and push the code to your Gerrit repository.

3. A warning link that you need to sign a CLA appears:

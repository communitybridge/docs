After the application is approved, the Linux Foundation finance team sets up an individual Expensify account for each beneficiary. Each beneficiary receives an email notification from the finance team that includes a link to their Expensify account. Beneficiaries are invited to join the custom Expensify policy as part of their participation in CommunityBridge. After accepting the invitation, beneficiaries have access to the policy where they can submit expenses for [reimbursement](get-reimbursed.md) from CommunityBridge funds.

The finance team also works with project administrator to set up a specific expense policy that applies to the fund. All the beneficiary and fund expenses are gated through the expense policy. For example, the policy might state a hotel price range that is acceptable for beneficiaries or a per diem food allowance. 

Only the project administrator can add or remove beneficiaries. The finance team is notified and adjusts the Expensify accounts accordingly.

## Event Budget <a id="EventApplication-EventBudget"></a>

**Sponsorship Goal** is a total funding goal amount for the year. The amount is a sum of the individual goal amounts.

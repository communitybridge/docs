# Project Managers

Project managers have responsibilities such as managing a project’s GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, members, repositories, and legal aspects like the CLA. Linux Foundation provides you admin access for the project, and you use the CLA Management Console.

Do the following CLA set-up:

1. Sign in to the Project Console
2. Configure the EasyCLA application.
3. ​[Add a CLA Group](add-a-cla-group.md).
4. ​[Add/Remove GitHub Repositories](add-github-repositories-to-cla-monitoring-or-remove-them-from-cla-monitoring.md) Or [Add/Delete Gerrit Instances](add-gerrit-instances-to-cla-monitoring-or-delete-them-from-cla-monitoring.md)

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* ​[View Current and Previous CLA PDFs](view-current-and-previous-cla-pdfs.md)​
* ​[Manage CLA Group Details](manage-cla-group-details.md)​

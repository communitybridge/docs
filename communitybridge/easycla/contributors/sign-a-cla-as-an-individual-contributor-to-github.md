# Sign a CLA as an Individual Contributor to GitHub

As an individual contributor to an open-source project who is contributing code on your own behalf \(and not on behalf of an employer\), you create a pull request in GitHub to inform code maintainers about changes made to the code. During the pull request process, your CLA is verified. Also during the process, you click a link to open the CLA Contributor Console to sign the CLA.

**Do these steps:**

1. In GitHub, go to the repository that is linked to the project for your organization.

2. Make a change and send a pull request.

{% hint style="info" %}
1. EasyCLA checks the CLA status of all committers involved in that pull request. EasyCLA marks a cross or a tick beside contributor names who are involved in that pull request based on their CLA status.
2. A cross next to your contributor name means the CLA check failed.
{% endhint %}

DocuSign presents the agreement that you must sign. The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so enter your personal email address in the E-Mail field.

6. Select the checkbox, click **CONTINUE**,  and follow the instructions in the DocuSign document, sign it, and click **FINISH**.

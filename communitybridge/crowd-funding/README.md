# Crowd Funding

CommunityBridge Funding is a platform that makes it possible for open source projects to raise money via donations from individuals and corporations. The goal behind the crowdfunding effort is to enable projects to pay maintainers and developers for their efforts and project expenses, and to ensure project communities have financial resources to secure, maintain, and advance open source.

Linux Foundation doesn't charge any fees for the first $10M raised through CommunityBridge, which allows developers to use more money for work, drive innovation, sustainability, and adoption.

**Project Administrators** submit funding applications for financial support from companies and individuals to grow their communities by paying money to developers for their contribution, by sponsoring project related travel meet-ups, spending money in marketing, and so on. Project administrators are the primary maintainers of the open source projects on CommunityBridge.

[Project administrators can also enroll their projects in a mentorship program](../mentorship/administrators/enroll-your-project/) to help aspiring developers learn while they contribute to their open source project. Projects can utilize raised funds to pay mentee stipends and provide travel scholarships for events and project summits.

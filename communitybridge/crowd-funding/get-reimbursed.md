# Get Reimbursed

Beneficiaries submit their requests for project-related expenses for reimbursement through Expensify. The review of the submitted expenses occurs in the following order:

1. The project administrator or event organizer validates and approves or rejects the expenses.
2. The Linux Foundation personnel reviews and processes all requests for expenditures to ensure the oversight of the funds and verify that all reported expenses align with the appropriate expense policy. 

Note: All expenses appear in the project's public ledger \(transaction list\) for full transparency.

Consider the following financial aspects of reimbursement before you make a request:

* CommunityBridge Funding uses Expensify, a third-party expense management and payment application that allows to create expense reports. After an expense report or invoice is reimbursed through that application, it is synchronized with CommunityBridge ledger as well to maintain full transparency.

Have these items handy before you begin:

* Receipts for the expenses that you want to submit for reimbursement
* The Expensify policy invitation email that you received from CommunityBridge

## Submit an Expense Report: <a id="GetReimbursed-SubmitanExpenseReport:"></a>

1. Follow these [steps in Expensify](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/docs/communitybridge/crowd-funding/how-to-create-and-submit-an-expensify-report) to create and submit an expense report. After you submit your report, the approver receives an email notification that your report requires attention. The approver reviews your reimbursement request and approves or rejects it. Next, a Linux Foundation administrator validates the expense and approves or rejects the reimbursement. Expensify funds your account.
2.  Upon approval notification, go to your account to access your reimbursement money. It may take up to 30 business days for the funds to be deposited to your bank account.\*

\*Wire Transfer recipients will get the funds deposited to their account directly from Linux Foundation.

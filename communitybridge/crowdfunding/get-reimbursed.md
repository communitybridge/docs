Consider the following financial aspects of reimbursement before you make a request:

* LFX Crowdfunding uses Expensify—a third-party expense management and payment application that allows to create expense reports. After an expense report or invoice is reimbursed through that application, it is synchronized with LFX ledger as well to maintain full transparency.

**Keep the following items ready before you begin:**

* Receipts for the expenses that you want to submit for reimbursement
* The Expensify policy invitation email that you received from the Linux Foundation.

## Submit an Expense Report: <a id="GetReimbursed-SubmitanExpenseReport:"></a>

1. Follow these [steps in Expensify](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/docs/communitybridge/crowd-funding/how-to-create-and-submit-an-expensify-report) to create and submit an expense report. After you submit your report, the approver reviews your reimbursement request and approves or rejects it. Next, a Linux Foundation administrator validates the expense and approves or rejects the reimbursement. Expensify funds your account.
2.  Upon approval notification, go to your account to access your reimbursement money. It may take up to 30 business days for the funds to be deposited to your bank account.\*

\*Wire Transfer recipients will get the funds deposited to their account directly from Linux Foundation.

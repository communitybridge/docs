# Donate as a Sponsor

Sponsors are organizations who can donate a minimum of $200.00 with no maximum amount. When you donate on behalf of an organization, you must be authorized by the organization to do so. Organizations making one-time donations may donate via an invoice, all other donations must be made with a credit or debit card.

        <p>The CII Badge Program is an open source secure development maturity model.
          Projects that have a CII badge showcase the project&#x2019;s commitment
          to security. Examples of criteria include basic open source development
          practices (website, open source license, and user engagement), use of change
          control tools, attention to quality (automated test suite), and focus on
          security (secure project delivery method, use of dynamic and static analysis
          tools, as appropriate for the project). Consumers of the badge are able
          to quickly assess which open source projects care about security-conscious
          development. Although participating in the CII Badge Program is optional,
          we encourage you to enroll in the program within the first 90 days from
          your application submission. The badge displays on your project dashboard
          to showcase your project&#x2019;s status and progress on security and other
          metrics.</p>
        <p>Click <b>Apply for CII</b> to get a badge and CII Project ID number if your
          project does not have one. You answer a questionnaire to be awarded a Best
          Practices Badge and a CII Project ID if you are approved. A questionnaire

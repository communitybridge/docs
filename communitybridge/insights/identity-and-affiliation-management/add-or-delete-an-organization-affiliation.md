# Add or Delete an Organization Affiliation

Organizations are shared accounts where open source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Affiliation Management lets you:

* Affiliate a profile with one or more organizations and for a specific enrollment period—this means that INSIGHTS counts the affiliated profile data in various organization charts and graphs.
* Delete an organization affiliation—this means that INSIGHTS does not count the affiliated profile data in organization charts and graphs.

**Do these steps:**

1. Select a **project name** of interest.
2. Select **Affiliation Management**.
3. Select a profile from **Top Unaffiliated Contributors** list or [search for a profile](find-a-profile.md).
4. Click a **row** that corresponds to a name of interest. Profile Information appears.
5. Go to **Organization Affiliation**. Organizations and their corresponding enrollment dates are listed.
6. Continue to add or delete organization affiliations:

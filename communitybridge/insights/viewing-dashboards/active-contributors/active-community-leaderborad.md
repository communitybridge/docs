# Active Community Leaderboard

Active Community Leaderboard displays an aggregated data of individual contributors for three major data sourcesâ€”Code based \(Git and Gerrit\), Issue Tracker \(Jira and GitHub Issues\), and Wiki page \(confluence\). Columns, such as Commits, LOC Added, LOC Modified, and LOC Deleted provide data of git repositories.

Click **Search** to search for a contributor's details, and click **Export** to download the table data to a `.csv` file. The Active Community Leaderboard Table lets you sort values by the following data:

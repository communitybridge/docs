# Accept to be a Mentor from an Email Invitation

When project administrator invites you to participate in the Mentorship program, you will receive an invitation email from CommunityBridge Team. You can chose to accept the invitation.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Select **Accept Invitation** in the invitation email.  
   One of the following results occurs:

   * If you already have a profile, a "You're been added to a project" message appears. Do _not_ continue to the next step—you can [manage your mentorship account](../../administrators/manage-your-mentorship-account.md).
   * If you do not have a profile, a [Mentor Application](create-a-mentor-profile.md) appears. Complete the application fields and click **Submit**. A confirmation informs you that you are a mentor and that you will be notified when the next term begins, for example:

   2. Click **My Profile** in your email to [manage your mentorship account](../../administrators/manage-your-mentorship-account.md#profiles).

# Configuring CLA for a Foundation

A Foundation, also called Group of Projects, is a project that has sub projects under it. As a project manager or an administrator, you can configure CLA for a foundation or a sub project under the foundation. For foundations such as CNCF, you configure CLA for the foundation, and it is applicable to all the sub projects that come under the foundation.

You can configure CLA group for a group of projects or individual projects. CLA groups are individual and/or corporate CLAs required for contribution to a project repository. A CLA group can be applied to a single repository, a group of repositories of a project,  an entire group of projects where each repository has its own repository set.

**To Configure CLA for a Foundation \(Group of Projects\):**

 1. On the Foundation page, click **Add new CLA Group**.

## Git Repositories &gt; **Overview** <a id="GitRepositories-GitRepositories&gt;Overview"></a>

SUMMARY: Overview shows information about commits in Git repositories. For each commit, Git stores information about who authored the commit \(author\) and when, and about the organization that included the commit in the repository.

**Git** shows the number of Commits, Authors, and Repositories for the project.

**Commits** shows a bar graph that represents the number of commits for the project over time. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the total number of commits for a date and time.

**Authors:**

* shows a bar graph that represents the number of authors for the project over time. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the total number of authors for a date and time.
* shows a table that lets you sort values by Author, Commits, Projects, Added Lines, Removed Lines, and Avg Files.

**Organizations:**

* shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of commits in the project by organization. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the total number of commits for the organization, and their percentage of the project's organization.
* shows a stacked bar graph that represents the number of commits by an organization per day over time. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the total number of commits for the organization and the date.
* shows a table that lets you sort values by Organization, Commits, Authors, Touched Files, Added Lines, Removed Lines, Projects, Repositories, and Avg Lines/Commit.

**Commits by Time Zone** shows a bar graph with a count of commits per Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\) time zone.

Mouse over a color in the graph to see the total number of commits for each time zone.

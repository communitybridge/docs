# Active Contributor Summary

**Note:** Only Project Administrators can view activity of contributors for their projects.

When contributors are relevant for Dev Analytics analysis, checking their activities is important. Affiliation Management manages different identities, such as email address and username for each contributor to a project data source. Each contributor's profile has personal details, and identity and organization affiliations when available. If a profile does not have an affiliation with an identity or organization, its contributions are not counted in various Dev Analytics dashboards. To address this problem, Affiliation Management manages contributor identities including capabilities for merging identities and other data related to them such as affiliation to organizations. [Affiliation Management identifies missing affiliations and helps you address them too.](../manage-contributor-affiliations/view-and-address-the-top-unaffiliated-contributors.md) This way, an analysis has a correct count of contributors in your projects—statistics are accurate because individual contributions are not underestimated.

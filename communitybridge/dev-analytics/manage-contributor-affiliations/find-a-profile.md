# Find a Profile

You can search by a name or keyword to find specific profiles. The search results let you identify what data \(for example, Email or Affiliations\) is not provided in a profile, and that you might want to add.

**Do these steps:**

1. Click a **project** of interest.

2. Click **Affiliation Management**.  
The Affiliation Management Home page shows Search Profiles field.

  * Affiliations shows the name of the organization that is affiliated with the profile.
  * Number \(\#\) shows the number of identities that are affiliated with the profile.

4. \(Optional\) Continue to [Add an Identity to a Profile](add-or-unmerge-a-profile-identity.md).

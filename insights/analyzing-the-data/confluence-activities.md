1. Click a **project name** of interest.
2. From the **Documentation** drop-down list, select **Confluence** &gt; **Overview**. The Overview dashboard shows information about Confluence activities. For details, see [Confluence Overview](../project-dashboards/documentation/confluence.md#Confluence-Confluence>Overview).

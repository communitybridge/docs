# Filter Data by Time Range

On **Trends** dashboard, you can select a time range form the time range bar to filter data. By default, the time range value is set to last 3 years on the time range bar. For more details, see [Time-Based Data Aggregation Methods](../trends.md#time-based-data-aggregation-methods).

* **Quick** shows preset time range values. Select a value, such as This Month, This Year, and so on, and click **Apply**.
* Clicking **Reset **changes the time range to default value–last 90 Days.
* **Calendar** lets you enter the start date and end date in the MM-DD-YY, HH:MM:SS format. Click **Apply **to see the project summary for the selected date and time.

The data refreshes to match your time range selection, and the value you selected shows next to the Time Range.

# Enroll Your Program

Enrolled mentorship programs are reviewed by The Linux Foundation before they're published and visible on the Mentorship platform.&#x20;

Submitted mentorship programs are reviewed based on the following factors:&#x20;

* Open source status - projects must be 100% open source&#x20;
* Community-wide adoption
* Alignment with The Linux Foundation’s support of open source initiatives

* The project ID for your [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Badge Program](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/badge-program/).
* A logo file in JPG, PNG, or SVG format that identifies your project.
* The URL for your code of conduct (the rules of behavior for the members of that group or organization).
* A list of names and email addresses for the individuals who you want to invite as mentors.

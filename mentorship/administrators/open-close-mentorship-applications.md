# Open & Close Mentorship Applications

1. To open or close mentorship program applications [Sign in](../../sso/sign-in/) to the [Mentorship](https://people.communitybridge.org/)

Select **My Projects** tab

2. In section **Projects for which I am an Administrator**, click **Open Applications**/**Close Applications** CTA on the program card. Once the applications are closed, the Apply CTA button on the program card is not longer active and no new mentees can apply to your program. 

**NOTE:** Closing the applications doesn't prevent mentees who started the application process from completing their prerequisite tasks.

# Manage Profile Visibility

You can manage your profile visibility by making your achievements, such as basic information, technical contribution, and so on public or private. You can keep all your profile information private or public based on your choice.

#### To manage profile visibility:

1\. Log in to [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev).

2\. From left side navigation pane click the arrow ![](../.gitbook/assets/arrow.png) to expand, and navigate to **Settings > Visibility**.

**Note**: By default, your profile visibility is private.

3\. From top right corner, click the **Public** radio button to let your _profile's basic_ _information_ visible to open source community.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Even if you click **Public**, your profile's only basic information becomes _public_ (visible to the community). To , make other information _public_, you must manually turn on each of them.
{% endhint %}

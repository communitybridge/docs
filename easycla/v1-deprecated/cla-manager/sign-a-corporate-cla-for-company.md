​[The CLA signatory receives a CLA Sign Request](../cla-signatories/review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md) email, reviews and signs the document.

After the Corporate CLA is signed, the Company page shows the signed Corporate CLA under Signed Project CCLAs. You receive a CLA Signed Document email with an attached document PDF. Contributors to the company project simply need to confirm their association to the company, and then they can continue with their pull requests. Their subsequent contributions will not require association confirmations.

_A Corporate CLA that is signed by the CLA signatory remains in effect even when that CLA signatory is no longer employed at a company._

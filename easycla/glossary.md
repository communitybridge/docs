# Glossary

#### Approved List

Approved Lists are lists of domain names, email addresses of individuals, GitHub usernames, or GitHub organization names who are authorized to contribute under a signed Corporate CLA. [CLA managers](glossary.md#cla-manager) create and manage the approved list.

#### **CLA**

A Contributor License Agreement \(CLA\) defines the terms under which intellectual property is contributed to a company or project. Typically, the intellectual property is software under an open source license. It is a legal contract signed by contributors before they can contribute code to a project.

#### **CCLA**

Corporate Contributor License Agreement \(CCLA\) defines terms and conditions under which employees contribute code on behalf of the company.

#### **CLA Template**

A CLA template is a document that contains terms and conditions under which contributors contribute code. The Linux Foundation provides an apache style CLA template that is generated after project managers provide project details while creating a CLA group, and contains information such as project name, project full entity name, and contact address. Project Managers use this template under a CLA group to let contributors sign before they can contribute code.

#### **CLA Group**

A CLA group defines CLA details, such as CLA types \(ICLA and/or CCLA\) a project requires for pull requests or push submissions, GitHub repositories and/or Gerrit instances that are CLA enforced, and projects under a foundation that are CLA enabled. One CLA group is used under a unique [CLA template](glossary.md#cla-template).

#### **ICLA**

Individual Contributor License Agreement \(ICLA\) defines terms and conditions under which individuals contribute code on behalf of their own.

#### **CLA Manager**

[CLA managers](cla-manager/) are authorized by the company to manage the list of approved contributors under a company’s Corporate CLA. They use the company dashboard to add and manage contributors and other CLA managers.

#### **CLA Signatory**

A [CLA signatory](cla-signatories/) signs CLA on behalf of the company. CLA signatories can be any individual with  legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.

#### CLA Corporate Console

Authorized corporate employees and CLA Managers use the [CLA Corporate Console](https://corporate.v1.easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#/companies) to view and manage company’s CLA information based on their permissions.

#### CLA Management Console

Project managers use the [CLA Management Console](https://project.v1.easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#/projects) to create CLA groups, add and manage projects, repositories, view who have signed the CLA, and perform many other activities for the projects they manage.

#### **Contributor Console**

While creating a PR, corporate and individual contributors are navigated to the contributor console to sign CLA under a CLA group before they can contribute to a project.

#### **Individual Contributor**

Individual contributors contribute code on their own behalf \(not on behalf of an employer\). CLA is verified while creating a PR, and they must sign CLA before they can contribute to GitHub or Gerrit. They are navigated to the LFX Contributor Console from GitHub or Gerrit to sign the CLA.

#### Project Manager

[Project managers](project-managers/) or Project admins are authorized by The Linux Foundation to maintain projects. They use the CLA Management Console where they have access to specific projects as per the permission provided by The Linux Foundation. They add and manage projects and repositories on the CLA Management Console.

#### **Legal Entity**

Legal entity is a team of The Linux Foundation that has legal rights and responsibilities to manage projects and provide access to project managers to maintain projects.

# Individual Contributor

An individual contributor is one who contributes code on their own behalf \(and not on behalf of an employer\). If you are contributing code on behalf of your employer, please see the [Corporate Contributor](corporate-contributor.md) workflow.

Upon creating a pull request in GitHub or submitting changed code in Gerrit, EasyCLA will check whether the contributor is authorized under a signed CLA for that project. If they are not, and if they are contributing on their own behalf, then they must sign an ICLA.

* [GitHub](individual-contributor.md#github)
* [Gerrit](individual-contributor.md#gerrit)

## GitHub

1. In GitHub, go to the repository where you are contributing code.

2. Make a change and create a pull request.

{% hint style="info" %}
1. EasyCLA checks the CLA status of all committers involved in that pull request. EasyCLA displays a cross or a check mark beside the name of each contributor who is involved in that pull request based on their CLA status.
2. A cross next to a contributor's name means the EasyCLA check has failed, because the contributor is not authorized under a signed CLA.
{% endhint %}

The CLA Contributor Console appears and shows the CLA group for your project.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If the project is not configured to use ICLAs, then **Proceed as an Individual Contributor** is inactive. In this case, individuals would not be able to contribute on their own behalf.
{% endhint %}

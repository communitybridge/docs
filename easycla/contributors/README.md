# Contributors

A Contributor is someone who contributes either on behalf of a company, or individually on their own behalf.

* If contributing on behalf of their company: the Cont​ributor will [confirm their association with a company that has a signed Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)](corporate-contributor.md).
  * If their company has not yet signed a CCLA, then the Contributor can start the workflow for the signing process.
  * If the Contributor has not yet been added to the authorized contributors list by their company's CLA Manager, then the Contributor can submit a request to their CLA Manager to be added.
* If contributing on their own behalf: the Contributor will ​[sign an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](individual-contributor.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** You should not submit a contribution under an ICLA if that contribution is done on behalf of your company. Instead, you should contribute under a Corporate CLA signed by your company. If you are uncertain whether you should be contributing under a CCLA or an ICLA, you should consult your employer's legal department to discuss.

## Known Issues

The following issues are known to be present in the v2.0.0 release of EasyCLA:

#### Two-Level Project Hierarchies

EasyCLA v2.0.0 supports projects with a parent-child model of at most two hierarchy levels. The following is an example:

* Parent Project
  * Child Project

Some projects may have deeper nesting of subprojects. Future releases will support nested project relationships.

#### Auto-Branch Protection 

Auto-Branch Protection only protects a repo's default git branch. Non-default branches are not currently auto-configured for EasyCLA protection. Currently, GitHub organization owners must manually set up branch protection rules for non-default branches.

#### Organization Association

Currently, user roles in EasyCLA can only be associated with a single company or organization at a time.

# Add or Delete CLA Managers

As a CLA Manager for a project, you can:

* [Add another CLA Manager for that project](add-or-delete-cla-managers.md#add-a-cla-manager)
* [Delete a CLA manager for that project](add-or-delete-cla-managers.md#delete-a-cla-manager)

### Add a CLA Manager:

**Note:** The new CLA Manager must have an [LF SSO account](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso) to be added as a CLA Manager. If they do not yet have one, they will need to [create one](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/create-an-account) before you proceed.

1. Sign in to the [EasyCLA Corporate Console](https://member.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/company/dashboard).

2. Navigate to the project for which you want to add a CLA Manager.

3. Navigate to **CLA Managers For My Organization** section, and click **+ Add CLA Manager**.

### Delete a CLA Manager:

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** A company that has signed a CCLA will always have at least one CLA Manager for that project. If they have only one CLA Manager, they must add another CLA Manager before deleting the first one.
{% endhint %}

Click ![](../../.gitbook/assets/delete-icon.png) under **Manage** column on a CLA manager's row to delete the user. There will always be one CLA Manager, and you cannot delete the CLA manager if there is only one CLA manager.

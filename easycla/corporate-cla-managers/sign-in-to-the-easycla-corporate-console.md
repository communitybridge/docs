# Sign In to the EasyCLA Corporate Console

A CLA Manager \(or someone who will become an initial CLA Manager after a CCLA is signed\) must sign in to the corporate console in order to [coordinate the CCLA signing process](./coordinate-signing-ccla.md), and to perform other activities.

1. Go to [https://member.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/company/dashboard](https://member.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/company/dashboard).
2. Enter your credentials and click **SIGN IN**.

If you do not have an LF SSO account, you will need to [create one](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/create-an-account) before using the EasyCLA Corporate Console.

After logging in, the EasyCLA Corporate Console appears and shows projects for which EasyCLA has been enabled.

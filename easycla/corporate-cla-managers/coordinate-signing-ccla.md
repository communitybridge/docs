# Coordinate Signing CCLA and become initial CLA Manager

Before a CCLA is signed, there is not yet an official "CLA Manager". Someone from the contributing company will be responsible for coordinating the CCLA signing process. That person will become the initial CLA Manager after it is signed.

This person (referred to internally in EasyCLA as the "CLA Manager Designee") can get designated as the initial CLA Manager either by starting the CCLA signing process themselves, or by being designated by another prospective contributor from their company who has started the EasyCLA CCLA process.

As the person who will become the initial CLA Manager, before starting the CCLA signing process, you will need to know the following before you proceed:
* Are you authorized to _sign_ the CCLA on behalf of your company?
* If you are not, what is the name and email address of someone who is authorized to sign?

You may need to consult with your management or legal department for guidance on the above questions.

## CCLA signing workflow

1. [Sign in](sign-in-to-the-easycla-corporate-console.md) to the [corporate console](https://member.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/).

2. Select the project from the **Search** field, and click **EasyCLA** under the project name.  

**Note:** If a CCLA signature workflow is already in process for this project, you may be taken to the screen shown in step 5.

3. Click **Start the CLA process**.

4. Click an answer: **Are you authorized to be a CLA Manager for your organization?**  
 ![](../../.gitbook/assets/company-has-not-signed-cla%20%281%29.png) 

If you are _not_ going to be your company's initial CLA Manager, then you will need to identify someone else as the initial CLA Manager; click **No** and go to the section below about [designating someone else as the initial CLA Manager](coordinate-signing-ccla.md#designating-another-initial-CLA-manager).

Otherwise, if you _are_ going to be your company's initial CLA Manager, then click **Yes** and continue.

5. You should see an entry indicating that the CCLA is pending signature. Under the **Action** column, click **Proceed with Signing**.  

![Proceed with Signing CLA](../../.gitbook/assets/proceed-with-signing.png)

**Result:** The Identify CLA Signatory window appears.

6. Select an answer: **Are you authorized to sign CLAs on your company's behalf?**  
 ![](../../.gitbook/assets/identify-cla-signatory.png) 

If you are _not_ authorized to sign the CCLA on behalf of your company, then you will need to identify someone else who is authorized to sign; click **No** and go to the section below about [choosing someone else to sign the CCLA](coordinate-signing-ccla.md#choosing-another-cla-signatory).

Otherwise, if you _are_ authorized to sign, then click **Yes** and continue.

7. The **Review CCLA** window appears. Click **Review & Sign CCLA**.

8. The **Preparing CCLA** window appears. After CCLA preparation is completed, click **Sign CCLA**.

![CCLA Ready for Signature](../../.gitbook/assets/ccla-ready-for-signature.png)

**Result:** You will be redirected to DocuSign to sign the CCLA.

9. Select the check box to agree to use electronic signatures, and click **Continue**. Follow the instructions in the DocuSign document to fill in the required fields, sign the CCLA, and click **Finish**.

**Result:** The CCLA is signed. You are now the CLA Manager from your company for this project. You will be redirected to the project page in the CLA Corporate Console, and your name and email address will appear under **CLA Managers From My Organization**:

![CCLA signed successfully](../../.gitbook/assets/cla-managers-from-my-organization-example.png)

You will now be able to [approve contributors](../corporate-cla-managers/approve-and-manage-contributors.md) to contribute to the project, and to [add others as additional CLA Managers](../corporate-cla-managers/add-or-delete-cla-managers.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
* After signing the CCLA, you will receive an email from The Linux Foundation confirming that it was signed.
* You can download the signed PDF document by clicking the link from that email, where you will be redirected to The Linux Foundation's website. If the download doesn't start automatically, click **Proceed to Download**.  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/proceed-to-download-ccla.png)
* You can also download the signed CCLA at any time from within the CLA Corporate Console.

## Designating someone else as initial CLA Manager <a id="designating-another-initial-CLA-manager"></a>

If you were mistakenly identified as the initial CLA Manager, you will need to designate someone else as the initial CLA Manager instead. After having clicked **No** in step 4 above, you will see the **Identify CLA Manager** form:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/identify-cla-manager.png)  

Enter the name and email address of the person who should be the initial CLA Manager, and click **Submit Request**.

If you are not sure who this should be, you can click the **Contact Company Admin** link, which may let you reach out to your company's LFX administrative contact if your company has set someone up with this role. Or you may need to reach out to your management or legal department for guidance.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will likely want to follow up with the specified person to confirm that they complete the CCLA signing process. They will need to have an [LF SSO](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso) account to use the CLA Corporate Console. If they don't have LF SSO account, they will need to [create one](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/create-an-account) before proceeding.
{% endhint %}

## Choosing someone else to sign the CCLA <a id="choosing-another-cla-signatory"></a>

If you are not authorized to sign the CCLA on behalf of your company, you will need to choose someone else who is authorized to sign. After having clicked **No** in step 6 above, you will see the **Identify Authorized Signatory** form: 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/identify-authorized-signatory.png) 

Enter the name and email address of the person who should sign the CCLA, and click **Send Signature Request Email**.  

After the CCLA is signed, you will be designated as the CCLA manager, and you will be able to begin [approving contributors](approve-and-manage-contributors.md).

# Corporate CLA Managers

A CLA Manager is the person who is responsible for managing the list of authorized contributors, and managing other aspects of their company's CCLA. 

The CLA Manager does the following activities via the [CLA Corporate Console](https://member.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/). \(Read here for [details on signing in](sign-in-to-the-easycla-corporate-console.md) to the console.\)

Before a CCLA is signed, there is not yet an official "CLA Manager". Someone from the contributing company will be responsible for coordinating the CCLA signing process. That person will become the initial CLA Manager after it is signed.

The person who will become the initial CLA Manager is responsible for:

* [Coordinating the CCLA signing process](coordinate-signing-ccla.md)

After the CCLA is signed, a CLA Manager of the company is responsible for:

* [Approving contributors](approve-and-manage-contributors.md)
* [Adding or deleting other CLA managers](add-or-delete-cla-managers.md)

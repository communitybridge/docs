# CCLA Signatories

A CLA Signatory is someone who is authorized to sign a CCLA on behalf of their company.

If the CLA Signatory is the same person as the initial CLA Manager, then they will sign the CCLA themselves while [coordinating the CCLA signing process](../corporate-cla-managers/coordinate-signing-ccla.md).

Otherwise, if the CLA Signatory is a different person than the initial CLA Manager, then the CLA Signatory will receive an email informing them that they are designated to be an authorized signatory for a company. The CLA Signatory can [review and sign the CCLA](review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md) on behalf of the company.

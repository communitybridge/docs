# EasyCLA Requirements

EasyCLA has the following requirements:

* Your project repositories are in GitHub or Gerrit
* If your project uses Gerrit source control, the Gerrit instance should be hosted on The Linux Foundation platform.
* You have an LF Single Sign-On \(SSO\) account. If you do not have an SSO account, [create an account](../../sso/create-an-account.md).
* For Corporate CLAs, your company has a corporate authority role

As a repository administrator, enable Branch Restrictions and Branch Protection for your organizations in GitHub. Set the restrictions and protection to enable required status checks on a branch regardless of the role for the organization.

# EasyCLA Requirements

For a project to use EasyCLA, it must meet the following requirements:

* The project repositories are in GitHub or Gerrit
* If the project uses Gerrit source control, the Gerrit instance should be hosted on The Linux Foundation platform.
* The repository administrator should enable Branch Restrictions and Branch Protection for the repository in GitHub. The restrictions and protection should be set to enable required status checks on a branch regardless of the role for the organization.

For a CLA Manager to access EasyCLA, they must register an LF Single Sign-On \(SSO\) account. If you do not have an LF SSO account, you can read how to [create an account here](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/create-an-account).

For a company to sign a project's CCLA, they will need to identify the appropriate company employees who will be the CLA Manager and CLA Signatory for that CCLA.

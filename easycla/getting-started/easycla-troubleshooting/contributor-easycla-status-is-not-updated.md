# Contributor's EasyCLA Status is not Updated

After a Contributor has signed an ICLA, it may take a few moments for the status of the EasyCLA checks to update. Please wait a few moments and then try refreshing the page.

For a CCLA, after a Contributor has been added to the approved list for the first itme, the CLA status will still display **Not Covered** for GitHub and **No Contributor Agreement** for Gerrit. The Contributor will need to take the following steps:

## Solutions:

## For GitHub

After being added to the approved list under their company's signed CCLA, the Contributor will need to go back to the Contributor Console and [acknowledge their association with the company](../../contributors/corporate-contributor.md#acknowledge-company-contribution). This is a one-time action and, after completion, will not be required for future contributions to that project.

Although it is uncommon, some projects may require a Contributor under a CCLA to additionally [sign an ICLA](../../contributors/corporate-contributor.md#if-you-are-asked-to-sign-icla). If this is required, then after completing the company acknowledgement, the Contributor will be guided to sign the project's ICLA.

## For Gerrit

Navigate to the Gerrit window, sign out and sign in again, and then submit a change.

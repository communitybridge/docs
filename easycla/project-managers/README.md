# Project Managers

A Project Manager sets up a project on EasyCLA, and manages configuration details, such as the GitHub organization or Gerrit instance and associated repositories. The Project Manager uses the Project Control Center for these actions.

As a Project Manager, you can perform the following activities:

1. [Sign in to Project Control Center](sign-in-to-project-control-center.md)
2. [Create New CLA Group](create-new-cla-group.md)
3. [Add GitHub organization](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#add-github-organization) or [Gerrit organization](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/#add-gerrit-organization)
4. [Enforce CLA monitoring for GitHub repositories](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring.md#enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring-from-github-repositories) or [Gerrit repositories](add-and-manage-git-organizations-and-repositories/enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring.md#enforce-cla-monitoring-for-gerrit-repositories)

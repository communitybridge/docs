# Project Managers

As a project manager, you have responsibilities to manage a project’s GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, members, repositories, and legal aspects like the CLA. You use the CLA Management Console to set up CLA.

To Set Up CLA:

1. ​[Sign in to the CLA Management Console](sign-in-to-the-easycla-management-console.md)
2. [Install the EasyCLA Application](install-the-easycla-application.md).
3. ​[Add a CLA Group](add-a-cla-group.md).
4. ​[Add Contributor License Agreements](add-contributor-license-agreements.md).
5. [Add/Remove GitHub Repositories](add-github-repositories-to-cla-monitoring-or-remove-them-from-cla-monitoring.md) Or [Add/Delete Gerrit Instances](add-gerrit-instances-to-cla-monitoring-or-delete-them-from-cla-monitoring.md)

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project's CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* ​[View Current and Previous CLA PDFs](view-current-and-previous-cla-pdfs.md)​
* ​[Manage CLA Group Details](manage-cla-group-details.md)​

# Get Access to EasyCLA

**Important:** Before you get started, make sure your project meets the [EasyCLA Requirements](../easycla-requirements.md).

**As a project manager, do these steps to get access to EasyCLA:**

1. If you do not have an LF Single Sign-on account, [create an account](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/create-an-account) before you proceed further.
2. Share your username with the EasyCLA administration team at [docucla@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:docucla@linuxfoundation.org).
3. Provide sample ICLA and CCLA template documents to the CLA administration team at [docucla@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:docucla@linuxfoundation.org).

After the CLA administration team confirms your setup, you can [Sign In to the CLA Management Console](sign-in-to-project-control-center.md) to do the EasyCLA activities as [project managers](../project-managers/).

**Note:** CCLA managers can immediately start using the CLA Corporate Console because it does not require activation from the EasyCLA administration team. Simply [Sign In to the Corporate CLA Console](../corporate-cla-managers/sign-in-to-the-easycla-corporate-console.md) to do the EasyCLA activities.

# Add and Manage Git Organizations and Repositories

Before you can add or manage Git repositories, you must connect/add Git organizations while setting up IT services. However, you can also add GitHub organization in the GitHub pane and add Gerrit instance in the Gerrit pane of **Tools** tab, as described below.

* [Add GitHub Organization](./#add-github-organization)
* [Enable Branch Protection and Auto Enable New Repositories](./#enable-branch-protection-and-auto-enable-new-repositories)
* [Disassociate GitHub Organization](./#disassociate-github-organization)
* [Add Gerrit Organization](./#add-gerrit-organization)
* [Disassociate Gerrit Organization](./#disassociate-gerrit-organization)

After you successfully add Git organizations, you can:

* [View Connection Status of Git Organization and Repositories](view-connection-status-of-git-organizations-and-repositories.md)
* [Enforce or Remove CLA Monitoring for Repositories](enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** To enable a CLA check on a repository, you must [enforce CLA monitoring](enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring.md#enforce-or-remove-cla-monitoring-from-github-repositories) for GitHub repositories or [add a Gerrit instance](./#add-gerrit-organization) for Gerrit repositories. Simply adding a GitHub organization to the project does not enable the EasyCLA check for any CLA groups.
{% endhint %}

### Enable Branch Protection and Auto Enable New Repositories

After adding the GitHub organization, you should enable branch protection and auto enable new repositories. **Enable Branch Protection** helps you to automatically enable the EasyCLA check for all the branches of the GitHub organization. If you select this check box, you do not need to [enable branch protection manually](../../getting-started/easycla-troubleshooting/easycla-is-disabled.md#enable-branch-protection).

If you add a new repository to the GitHub organization, selecting **Auto Enable New Repositories** automatically adds the repository under the GitHub organization on the project console.

1. Click the settings icon ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/settings%20%281%29.png) next to **Additional Settings** for a GitHub organization.
2. Click both of the check boxes.

![Additional Settings](../../../.gitbook/assets/additional-setttings.png)

### Disassociate GitHub Organization

1. Click the settings icon ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/settings%20%281%29.png) next to **Additional Settings** for a GitHub organization.

2. Click **Disassociate GitHub Org**, and click the link to create a support ticket to disassociate the GitHub org.

### Add Gerrit Organization

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** 

* If you have already added a Gerrit instance during the EasyCLA on-boarding process, skip this procedure unless you want to add more Gerrit instances.
* After you add a Gerrit organization, all of its repositories are EasyCLA-enabled by default.
{% endhint %}

 1. Click the **+** sign at the top right of Add Gerrit Organization.

![Add Gerrit Organization](../../../.gitbook/assets/add-gerrit-organization.png)

2. Complete the form fields, and click **Connect**.
**Gerrit Instance Name** - Name of the Gerrit Instance  
**Gerrit Instance URL** - URL of the Gerrit Instance  
**ICLA Group ID** - An existing LDAP Group ID for Individual CLAs  
**CCLA Group ID** - An existing LDAP Group ID for Corporate CLAs

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes:**

* Contact the Linux Foundation IT team to get Gerrit Instance Name and URL.
* Contact the Linux Foundation IT team if you do not know the LDAP Group IDs.
* One or both LDAP groups must exist for you to be able to create a Gerrit instance. If a group does not exist, an error message appears and you are prevented from creating a Gerrit instance.
{% endhint %}

The EasyCLA project console lists the CLA-enabled instances, as shown below.​​  
**Note:** You cannot disable the CLA check for individual Gerrit repositories.

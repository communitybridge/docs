2. Click a **project** of interest.

3. Navigate to **Tools** tab, and click **CLA**.

### Enforce CLA Monitoring for Gerrit Repositories

After you[ add a Gerrit organization](./#add-gerrit-organization), by default all of its repositories are CLA enabled. You cannot disable CLA for an individual Gerrit repository. However, you can [disassociate the Gerrit organization](./#disassociate-gerrit-organization) to disable CLA for the organization and all of its repositories.

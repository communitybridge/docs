# Corporate Contributor

A corporate contributor is one who contributes code on behalf of their employer (and not on their own behalf). If you are contributing code on your own behalf, please see the [Individual Contributor](individual-contributor.md) workflow.

Upon creating a pull request in GitHub or merge request in GitLab or submitting changed code in Gerrit, EasyCLA will check whether the contributor is authorized under a signed CLA for that project. If they are not, and if they are contributing on behalf of their employer, then they will need to be authorized under a signed Corporate CLA (CCLA):

* If their company has not yet signed a CCLA, then the contributor can start the workflow for the signing process.
* If the contributor has not yet been added to the authorized contributors list by their company's CLA Manager, then the contributor can submit a request to their CLA Manager to be added.
* If the CCLA has been signed and the contributor is on the authorized contributors list, then the contributor will need to confirm their association with the company, and then will be able to proceed.
* [GitHub](corporate-contributor.md#github)
* [Gerrit](corporate-contributor.md#gerrit)
* [GitLab](corporate-contributor.md#gitlab)

## GitHub

2. A cross next to a contributor's name means the EasyCLA check has failed, because the contributor is not authorized under a signed CLA.

## If you are additionally asked to sign an ICLA <a href="#if-you-are-asked-to-sign-icla" id="if-you-are-asked-to-sign-icla"></a>

For certain projects, in addition to being authorized under your company's signed CCLA, you may also be required to individually sign an ICLA on your own behalf.

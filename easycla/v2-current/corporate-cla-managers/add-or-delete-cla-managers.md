# Add or Delete CLA Managers

As a CLA Manager for a project, you can:

* ​[Add another CLA Manager for that project](add-or-delete-cla-managers.md#add-a-cla-manager)​
* ​[Delete a CLA manager for that project](add-or-delete-cla-managers.md#delete-a-cla-manager)​

## Add a CLA Manager: <a href="#add-a-cla-manager" id="add-a-cla-manager"></a>

**Note:** The new CLA Manager must have an [LF SSO account](../../../sso/) to be added as a CLA Manager. If they do not yet have one, they must [create one](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/create-an-account) before you add them as a CLA Manager.

1. Sign in to the [EasyCLA Corporate Console](https://organization.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/company/dashboard).
2. Navigate to the project for which you want to add a CLA Manager.
3. Navigate to **CLA Managers For My Organization** section, and click **+ Add CLA Manager**.

**Important:** A company that has signed a CCLA will always have at least one CLA Manager for that project, and you cannot delete the CLA manager if there is only one CLA manager.
{% endhint %}

Click ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/delete\_icon.png) under **Manage** column on a CLA manager's row to delete the user.

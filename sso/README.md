# Single Sign-On \(SSO\)

Linux Foundation provides a unified Single Sign-On service \(SSO\) to provide secure access and protect the identities of all its communities. Linux Foundation managed systems and services like Events Registration, Training and Certification, Jenkins, JIRA, Gerrit, Confluence, CommunityBridge \(Funding, Mentorship, EasyCLA, INSIGHTS, Security\) are already protected by this SSO service. Additional services to be covered in near future will include Zoom, Slack, Groups.io among others. 

Creating an account is a simple one time exercise. All you need is an email. You can create a username and password of your choice. In case you already have a legacy Linux Foundation login \(formerly known as LFID\), you can re-use that. Most of us forget passwords; hence the SSO service provides an easy way of resetting your password.

You can also log in using 3rd party authentication service providers, such as Google, GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook.

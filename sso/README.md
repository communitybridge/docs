# Single Sign-On \(SSO\)

Linux Foundation provides a unified Single Sign-On service \(SSO\) to provide secure access for participants in our communities. 

The SSO service protects Linux Foundation managed systems and services like Events Registration, Training and Certification, Jenkins, JIRA, Gerrit, Confluence, CommunityBridge \(Funding, Mentorship, EasyCLA, INSIGHTS, Security\). Additional services to be covered in near future will include Zoom, Slack, Groups.io among others. 

Creating an account is a simple: all you need is an email. You can create a username and password of your choice. In case you already have a legacy Linux Foundation login \(formerly known as LFID\), you can re-use that. 

You can also create your SSO by using 3rd party authentication service providers, such as Google, GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook.

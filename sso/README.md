# Single Sign-On \(SSO\)

Linux Foundation's Single Sign-On service \(SSO\) provides secure access and identity protection for participants in its communities. 

The SSO service already protects other Linux Foundation managed systems and services like Events Registration, Training and Certification, Jenkins, JIRA, Gerrit, Confluence, CommunityBridge \(Funding, Mentorship, EasyCLA, INSIGHTS, Security\). Additional services to be covered in near future will include Zoom, Slack, and Groups.io. 

To create an account, all you need is an email and a password. If you already have a legacy Linux Foundation login \(formerly known as LFID\), you can re-use that.

You can also log in using 3rd party identity providers (IdPs), such as Google, GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook. 

If you need help, you can go to [https://support.linuxfoundation.org](https://support.linuxfoundation.org) to file a ticket.

You will be able to view what email addresses and IdPs are associated with your SSO username by going to [https://myprofile.linuxfoundation.org](https://myprofile.linuxfoundation.org) after July 10th, 2020.

# Single Sign-On \(SSO\)

The Linux Foundation provides a unified Single Sign-On service \(SSO\) that offers secure access and protects the identities of all its community members. The Linux Foundation systems and services like Events Registration, Training and Certification, Jenkins, JIRA,  Confluence, Gerrit, Groups.io, Crowdfunding, Mentorship, EasyCLA, Insights, and Security are all protected by the SSO service. Additional services to be covered in near future will include Zoom and Slack, among others. 

To create an account and log in you need an email address. You can also sign in using 3rd party authentication service providers such as Google, Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn. 

## What is the SSO Login Page?

When you log in to a program or a tool for a project, you will likely be asked to create your LF account. 

The LF account you will create will also allow you to authenticate using services like Google, LinkedIn, Facebook and GitHub in addition to using your username and password.

For example, if you sign up for or log in to your mailing list via the Groups.io web portal, you will be asked to log in through the new SSO interface and create an LF account if you don't have one.  

## Why are we providing this service?

The SSO helps to secure your access to a service, whether it is registering for an event, subscribing to a mailing group, or accessing a community meeting or webinar. 

In addition to increased security, it’s also a greater convenience. Since you already use the identity provider for your common workflows, you have one less password to remember, and can often sign in quickly depending on the browser or client you are using.

## How do I view emails associated with my LF Account?

You can view emails associated with your LF Account at your Individual Dashboard at [https://myprofile.linuxfoundation.org](https://myprofile.linuxfoundation.org).

On the Individual Dashboard you can also:

* View which email addresses are associated with your LF Account
* View the username for your LF Account
* View the Identity Providers \(IdPs\) you have enabled

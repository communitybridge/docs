# Sign in with Facebook

You can use your Facebook login credentials to sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating an LF account. The first time you sign in, you will enter your Facebook credentials to authenticate your Facebook account. Subsequent logins will not require you to enter the credentials⏤you will simply click the **Facebook** icon to sign in. This one-click approach simplifies your login process.

3\. If you have an existing LF account, the Linux Foundation will map it to your Facebook login. If you don't have an LF Account associated with the email address you're using, you will be navigated to **Create your LF Account** page.                                                                                                                                             &#x20;

# Sign in with GitHub

You can use your GitHub login credentials to sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating an LF account. The first time you sign in, you will enter your GitHub credentials to authenticate your GitHub account. Subsequent logins will not require you to enter the credentials⏤you will simply click the **GitHub** icon to sign in. This one-click approach simplifies your login process.

5.  If you don't have an LF Account associated with the email address you're using, you will be navigated to **Create your LF Account** page.
